# Move13 Task

Along with a link to this repo, you should have received a pdf with instructions. In order to use the code contained
here, you will need `python >= 3.4`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `opencv-python`. The essential code for you to integrate 
into the application is in `source/optimizer.py`. Docstrings and unit tests (in `source/optimizer_test.py`) should 
provide sufficient information for use, but if you get stuck you may contact David Loving with any questions. The image 
that you should use for testing is in the `data` folder.
